     * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead.

     * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid.
