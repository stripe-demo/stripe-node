 * `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
 * represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
 * just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
 * attached to customers.
 *
 * Stripe doesn't recommend using the deprecated [Sources API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/sources).
 * We recommend that you adopt the [PaymentMethods API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods).
 * This newer API provides access to our latest features and payment method types.
