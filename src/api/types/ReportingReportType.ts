/**
 * The Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as
 * the "Activity summary" or "Itemized payouts" reports. These objects are
 * identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See
 * [API Access to Reports documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/statements/api)
 * for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.
 *
 * Note that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode
 * data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes).
