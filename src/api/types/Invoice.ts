/**
 * Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
 * generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
 *
 * They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
 * that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
 * Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
 * that finalizing the invoice,
 * [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
 * not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
 * until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
 * webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
 * connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
 * creation to finalize the invoice.
 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
 * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
 * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
 * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
 *
 * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
 * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
 * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
 * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
 * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
 * customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
 *
 * More details on the customer's credit balance are
 * [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).
