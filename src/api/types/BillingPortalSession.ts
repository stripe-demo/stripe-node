 * A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you

 *
 * A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
 * a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
 * can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
 * sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
 * Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
