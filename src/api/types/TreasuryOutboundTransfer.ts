/**
 * Use [OutboundTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers) to transfer funds from a [FinancialAccount](https://stripe.com/docs/api#financial_accounts) to a PaymentMethod belonging to the same entity. To send funds to a different party, use [OutboundPayments](https://stripe.com/docs/api#outbound_payments) instead. You can send funds over ACH rails or through a domestic wire transfer to a user's own external bank account.
 *
 * Simulate OutboundTransfer state changes with the `/v1/test_helpers/treasury/outbound_transfers` endpoints. These methods can only be called on test mode objects.
