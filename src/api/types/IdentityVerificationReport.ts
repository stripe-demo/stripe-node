/**
 * A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
 * The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options`
 * parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the
 * appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.
 *
 * Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
 * reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)
 * API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the
 * [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.
 *
 * Related guide: [Accessing verification results](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/verification-sessions#results).
