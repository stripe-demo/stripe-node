     * For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) until the bank details are updated.
     *
     * For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`. If a payout fails, the status is set to `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details are updated. In the US and India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply.
