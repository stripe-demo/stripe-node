 * [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
 * connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
 * to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
 * platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.
 *
 * Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
 * charge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
 * the charge. It is possible to reverse a
 * [transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-options)
 * transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
 * reversal.
